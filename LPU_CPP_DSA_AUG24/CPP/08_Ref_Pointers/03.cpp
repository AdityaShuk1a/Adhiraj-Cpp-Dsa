//Types of pointers

#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main()
{
 //--------------------------------
 /*
    1. NULL pointer -> a pointer that does not point to anything
    int *ptr = NULL;


    2. Dangling pointer -> a pointer that is pointing to a memory location that has either been deleted or freed.

    3. Void pointer -> a pointer that isn't associated with any data type
    void *ptr

    4. Wild pointer -> pointer that has unpredictable behaviour because it hasn't been initialized.
    int *ptr;
